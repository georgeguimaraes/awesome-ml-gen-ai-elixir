# Awesome ML & GenAI in Elixir

A curated list of Machine Learning (ML) and Generative AI (GenAI) packages and resources for the [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) programming language.

Besides giving an overview for experienced Elixir developers, this list can be useful for ML and AI practitioners looking for other ecosystems.
